Create a grid of coordinates as array of dictionary 5x5Have dictionary choose 3 random coordinates.  Ask my input for my 3 chosen coordinates
Get input from me to choose a coordinate. If my coordinate is the same as one of the computers random coordinates, "Hit", else "Miss".Then computer randomly chooses a coordinate. If that is the same as one of my chosen coordinates then "Hit" otherwise "Miss". If I accumulate 3 Hits then " You win!", if computer accumulates 3 Hits, "Computer wins, you lose", "Game over, try again?"
